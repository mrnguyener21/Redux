FLUX: an architecture that helps dealing with data (actions, dispatcher reducer, store)

Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces.
Similar to (and inspired by) Facebook's Flux architecture, it was created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark.

Redux is a small library with a simple, limited API designed to be a predictable container for application state.
It operates in a similar fashion to a reducing function, a functional programming concept.

What is Flux?
Flux is the application architecture that Facebook uses for building client-side web applications.

What does it do?
It complements React's composable view components by utilizing a unidirectional data flow.

How do I use it?
It's more of a pattern rather than a formal framework, and you can start using Flux immediately without a lot of new code.

Action: an object that contains a type property and can also contain payload

Provider: a wrapper component for the entire application;
store: global state;
dispatch: to send, fire an action
